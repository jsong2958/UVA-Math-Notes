\section{Subspaces}

\begin{definition}[Subspace]
A subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is a \term{subspace} if $W$ is a vector space over $F$ with the operations defined on $V$. The subspace $\{ \emph{0} \}$ is called the \term{zero subspace} of $V$.
\end{definition}

The following is the theorem to prove if a subset is a subspace of $V$:

\begin{theorem}
    Let $W$ be a subset of the vector space $V$. Then $W$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if the following hold:
\end{theorem}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item $0 \in W$
    \item $x + y \in W$, for $x, y \in W$
    \item $cx \in W$, for $c \in \mathbb{F}$ and $x \in W$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{example}[Polynomials]
\end{example}
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $P_n(F)$ be the set containing all the polynomials in $P(F)$ having degree less than or equal to n.
\\
To show that it is a subspace, we use the theorem and see if the three condition holds. The zero polynomial has degree $-1 \leq n, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.
The sum of two polynomials with degree less than or equal to n still has the degree less than or equal to n, along with scalar multiplication.
