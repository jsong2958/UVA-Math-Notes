\section{Vector Spaces}

A vector taught in previous courses may have defined one as a quantity with a magnitude and direction, commonly represented as an arrow. Here, we define what a vector is rigorously.

\begin{definition}
A \term{vector space} V over a field F is a set in which two operations, addition and scalar multiplication, are defined so that for each pair of elements \mm{x, y \in V}, the sum \mm{x + y} is also in V, and for any scalar \mm{c \in F}, the product cx is also an element of V, such that the following axioms hold:
