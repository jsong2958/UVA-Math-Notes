\section{Vector Spaces}

A vector taught in previous courses may have defined one as a quantity with a magnitude and direction, commonly represented as an arrow. Here, we define what a vector is rigorously.

\begin{definition}[Vector Space]
A \term{vector space} V over a field F is a set in which two operations, addition and scalar multiplication, are defined so that for each pair of elements \mm{x, y \in V}, the sum \mm{x + y} is also in V, and for any scalar \mm{c \in F}, the product cx is also an element of V, such that the following axioms hold:
\end{definition}

\begin{axioms}
    \item For all \mm{x, y \in V, x + y = y + x}
    \item For all \mm{x, y, z \in V, (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)}
    \item There exists the zero vector in V, denoted \mm{0}, such that \mm{x + 0 = x, \forall x \in V}
    \item For each \mm{x \in V, \exists y \in V} such that \mm{x + y = 0}
    \item For each x in V, \mm{1x = x}
    \item For each scalar \mm{a, b \in F} and each element \mm{x \in V}, \mm{(ab)x = a(bx)}
    \item For each element \mm{a \in F}, and each pair of elements \mm{x, y \in V}, \mm{a(x + y) = ax + ay}
    \item For each pair of scalars \mm{a, b \in F} and each element \mm{x \in V, (a + b)x = ax + bx}
\end{axioms}


\mm{\star} Elements of F are scalars, elements of V are vectors. Most cases, the vector space is over the field \mm{\mathbb{R}} or \mm{\mathbb{C}}\newline

\textbf{Vector Space Examples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{N-tuples}: \mm{(a_1, a_2, a_3,...,a_n), a_n \in F}. The set of n-tuples with n entries of \mm{F} is the set \mm{F^n}.
    \item \textbf{Matrices}: An m x n matrix with entry \mm{a_{i_j}}, where m is the row and n is the column.\\
    \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\ 
        a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    \item \textbf{Functions}: Let \mm{S} be a nonempty set and \mm{F} be any field. Denote \mm{F(S, F)} be the set of all functions that maps from \mm{S} to \mm{F}.
    \item \textbf{Polynomials}: Denote P(\mm{F}) as the set of all polynomials with coefficients from \mm{F}.
    \[
        f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
    \]
\end{itemize}

\mm{\star} These are all vector spaces because they are sets that hold the addition and scalar multiplication operations.

\begin{theorem}[Cancellation Law for Vector Addition]
If \mm{x, y, z \in V}, such that \mm{x + z = y + z}, then \mm{x = y}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By (4), there exists a vector v such that \mm{z + v = 0}. \\
    Thus, \[x + 0 = x \, (3) = x + (z + v) = (x + z) + v \, (2) = (y + z) + v, = y + (z + v) \, (2) = y + 0 = y \, (3)\]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    The vector 0 in (3) is unique
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Consider \mm{0'}.
    \[
    0 = 0 + 0' \, (3) = 0'
    \]
\end{proof}
